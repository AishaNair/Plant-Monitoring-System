# Plant-Monitoring-System
This repository consists of local code and remote code for an Arduino Uno device for building a Plant Monitoring System. It helps in monitoring the moisture levels in the soil of the plant and watering it accordingly.
The Setup requires:

1. Arduino Uno Boards (To communicate with each other)

2. Grove Base Shields (To connect Grove Moisture Sensors)

3. XBee (For wireless communications)

4. Grove Moisture Sensors (As many sensors as your plants)

5. USB connectors (To connect your Arduino to a PC or a Raspberry Pi)
 
The Setup looks like this:
